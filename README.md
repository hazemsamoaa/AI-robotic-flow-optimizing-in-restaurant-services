# AI-robotic-flow-optimization-in-restaurant-services
This project is about find the optimal path for the intelligent robot to serve many tables in restaurant taking into account quick serving 
This project is dedicated for one robot in one resturant (specific environment) that move form one table to other table respecting the possible ways from tables. 
The main target here is to build such an algorithm that make this robot move between the tables in an optimal way in order to serve the tables in an optimal way
In this case we want to study the enviroment and see the possible roads across tables. Tables will be read it as the states. So the robot should move from one table to another tabe respecting the enviroment (again resturant design)
For tackeling this problem we will use reinforcement learning specifically (Q-learning).
